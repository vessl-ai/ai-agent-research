# AI Agent Research

A collection of research projects exploring different aspects of AI agents and their applications.

## Projects

### [CrewAI Process Type Comparison](./crewai-process-type)
Investigates and compares different process types (Sequential vs Hierarchical) in CrewAI for conducting research and generating reports. This project demonstrates how different agent orchestration methods affect performance and output quality.

### [Agentic RAG System](./agentic-rag)
Implements and compares two different Retrieval-Augmented Generation approaches using CrewAI:
1. PDFSearchTool for direct PDF document analysis
2. CrewDoclingSource for knowledge-based document processing

The system combines document analysis with web search capabilities to perform comprehensive research and generate detailed reports. It includes performance comparisons between the two RAG approaches.
